To proceed after updating the SQL file, follow these steps:

1. **Open pgAdmin or your preferred SQL client**:
   - Launch pgAdmin or any other SQL client you are using to connect to your PostgreSQL database.

2. **Connect to your Database**:
   - In pgAdmin, navigate to the `sql_course` database in the Object Explorer.

3. **Open the Query Tool**:
   - Right-click on the `sql_course` database and select `Query Tool` to open a new SQL query window.

4. **Copy and Paste the SQL Commands**:
   - Copy the contents of the updated `3_modify_tables.sql` file and paste them into the Query Tool.

5. **Execute the SQL Commands**:
   - Click the execute button (usually a play icon) or press F5 to run the SQL commands.

6. **Check for Errors**:
   - Monitor the output for any errors. If the commands execute successfully, you should see a confirmation message.

7. **Verify the Changes**:
   - Run a SELECT query to verify that the data has been loaded correctly and that the changes are reflected in the database.

Example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM job_postings_fact LIMIT 100;
```

8. **Review the Results**:
   - Check the results to ensure that the data appears as expected.
