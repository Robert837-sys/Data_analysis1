# Steps to Resolve VS Code Permission Issues

1. **Run VS Code as Administrator**:
   - Close VS Code if it is currently open.
   - Right-click on the VS Code icon and select "Run as administrator."
   - This grants VS Code elevated permissions, which may resolve access issues.

2. **Check VS Code Settings**:
   - Open VS Code and go to "File" > "Preferences" > "Settings."
   - Search for "files.autoSave" and ensure it is set to "onWindowChange" or "afterDelay" to avoid file locking issues.

3. **Check File Permissions Again**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing the CSV files (C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\DataNerd\csv_files).
   - Right-click on each CSV file and select "Properties."
   - Go to the "Security" tab and ensure that the user running VS Code has "Read" permissions.

4. **Check PostgreSQL Service Permissions**:
   - Ensure that the PostgreSQL service is running under a user account that has access to the CSV files.
   - You can check this in the "Services" application on Windows.

5. **Test the Commands Again**:
   - After making the necessary changes, try running the `COPY` commands again in pgAdmin or the PSQL Tool.

Follow these steps to resolve any potential permission issues related to VS Code and ensure that it can access the necessary files.
